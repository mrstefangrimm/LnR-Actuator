# LnR-Actuator
The linear and rotary (LnR) actuator is a electromechanical device that allows linear as well as rotary motion of the shaft.

## Project History
A first revision was released in 2018. The construction has been simplified and made stiffer since then. All *[released revisions](https://github.com/mrstefangrimm/LnR-Actuator/releases)* are mechanical compatible. 

## Construction
A detailed description how to build a LnR-Actuator is published on *[Instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/id/Linear-and-Rotation-Actuator/)*.
